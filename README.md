# OWDataExtractor_Dataset
Dataset of stats exported using OWDataExtractor


#### To calculate which directory your exported data should go in:
1. Take the player with the highest SR and subtract their SR from that of the player with the lowest SR.
2. If this number is greater than 500, it belongs in "Miscellaneous."
3. Otherwise, get the average SR of all players and place the data in the folder that corresponds with the range this number falls in.


#### Naming convention:
`AverageSR_DD-MM-YY_identifier.json`  
identifier is optional. If you don't include identifier, don't include the underscore before it either.


#### How to submit to this repository:
1. Make a fork of the repo.
2. Add the data you want to add to the repository.
3. Make a pull request to the original repo.
